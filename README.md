## Make Change Project - Week 1 Skill Distillery

### Overview
The project is a cash register designed to:

- receive input from a user for the cost of an item;
- receive input from a user for the amount tendered for an item;
- return the proper amount of change, if the amount tendered > the price of item;
- return an error message if the amount tendered and the price are equal;
- and return an error message if the amount tendered is less than the price of the item.

To use, enter the price of the item and the amount tendered, when prompted.

The program will have to be rerun with every new series of entries.

### Technologies Used
- Eclipse
- Java
- GitHub/Git

### Lessons Learned
There was an issue whereby the amount of pennies would be incorrect; I was unable to determine whether it was my use of if/else loops within a while loop, but changing the while loop to a series of if loops appeared to fix it.
